subtitle: "AI Powered Post-Game Content Creation"
project_title: "FIFA Club World Cup 2025: Developing Post-game content using AI for automated soccer box scores and video news reports"

problem: |
  After a soccer match, fans want quick and exciting updates. But creating game summaries, stats, and videos takes a lot of time and effort. As more matches are played around the world, it's getting harder to keep up.

  This project wants to solve that problem by using AI to create box scores and video news reports automatically. This will help fans get updates faster and in a more fun way.
approach: |
  The project follows a five-phase pipeline:

  - Collect live match data and old game summaries from sports news websites.
  - Use data analysis tools (pandas, NumPy) to clean, organize, and prepare match statistics for machine learning input.
  - Train AI models using deep learning tools like PyTorch or TensorFlow to create short text summaries (like box scores and highlights).
  - Use text-to-speech tools to turn the summaries into natural-sounding voice clips.
  - Build a system that combines data ingestion, AI summarization, and voice generation, with final results shared via a student-developed presentation or report.

  Open-source tools such as GitHub, PyTorch, TensorFlow will be used to prototype the system.

outcome: |
  The project will produce a working system that can turn live soccer match data into short text summaries and voice clips. The project will also provide ideas for improving how AI is used in sports media in the future.
