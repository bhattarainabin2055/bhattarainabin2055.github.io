what_i_learned: |
  I gained a solid understanding of computer vision and how it works. I learned about both object oriented and image oriented approches of computer vision. I learned about Teachable Machine which allowed me to train a model by providing images of pen, phone and remote and later asking it to identify those objects. I also woked with YOLO v8 in Google Colab where I used nano model to predict object in the image I uploaded and XL model to predict objects in the video I uploaded. We played Virtual Escape Room which was engaging and fun. I did some problems in Python to add, delete, update items in dictionary using function for each action. Likewise, I learned about intersection, union and difference in sets. I learned about File, Input and Output, types of File and File access method. I also learned how to read, write and append data in files in replit.

reflection: |
  Computer Vision helped me understand how it is used in our daily life such as driving a Tesla, fingerprint and Face ID in phones and many more. Virtual escape room game sharpened my ability to think critically, divide tasks and share ideas. I got a chance to learn about new topics like introduction to file, input and output. Overall, it was a good learning.
