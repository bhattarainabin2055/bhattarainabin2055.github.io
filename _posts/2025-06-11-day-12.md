what_i_learned: |
  Today I learned how APIs can be used to get real-time or historical data from the internet. I learned how to send requests using Python and how to include headers and parameters to get specific information. I discovered how to read and understand JSON data, which is a common format used in APIs. I also learned how to extract the important parts of the data, like team names, scores, and venues. Using pandas, I saw how data can be organized into tables for easier analysis. Finally, I learned how to write simple logic to understand results, like figuring out which team won a match.

blockers: |
  Debugging the code to get data of a particular team in a particular season was hard and took time.
  
reflection: |
  Today was a productive day because I learned how to work with APIs and understand live sports data using Python. At first, it was a bit challenging to understand how the request and response system worked, but with practice, it became clearer. I realized how powerful Python can be when combined with real-world data. I felt proud when I was able to extract match details and determine the winner using logic. Overall, I feel more confident in handling data from the web and am excited to keep learning more.
