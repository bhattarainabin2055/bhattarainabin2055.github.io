what_i_learned: |
  It was our first day of in person program. I got to learn more about CEAMLS and its objectives. I learned what dependent and independent variables are. I learned about deterministic and non-deterministic systems. I got to learn more about AI and how it has impacted our lives. We played Marshmallow and Spaghetti game to build the tallest standing structure. Unfortunately, my group 12 was not able to win it, but it encouraged collaboration and innovation among the groups.

  No blockers.

reflection: |
  Overall it was a productive day. Last week we were just seeing each other online, but it was great to see each other personally and get to know about them. Marshmallow and spaghetti game was fun. Though we did not make the tallest structure, it was nice to see different approach by different groups.
