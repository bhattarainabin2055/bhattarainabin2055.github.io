  bio: |
    I‚Äôm currently a senior studying Computer Science at Morgan State University in Baltimore, MD. I expect to graduate in 2026.

    I am doing a research on developing post-game content using AI for automated box scores and video news reports for FIFA Club World Cup 2025.

    When I‚Äôm not working on research, I enjoy watching movies and soccer.
