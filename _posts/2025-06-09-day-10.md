what_i_learned: |
  I got a chance to know about all the students that are participating in this research program. I learned what Git and GitHub was. I also set up my GitHub account and CEAMLS SAIRI Summer 2025 Research Website. I know how to use GitHub now. We played speed networking Bingo which helped me learn more about Git and GitHUb. Placement test on Python helped me revise my learning on Python.

reflection: |
  It was great learning about Git and GitHub since I have never heard and learned about it. Playing speed networking bingo was fun and informational at the same time. Placement test on Python helped me check my knowledge on Python and topics that I need to learn more. It was wonderful getting to know all the participants. I enjoyed our first day of CEAMLS SAIRI.
