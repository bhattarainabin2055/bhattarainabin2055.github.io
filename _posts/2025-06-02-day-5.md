what_i_learned: |
  It was our first day of in person program. I got to learn more about CEAMLS and its objectives. I learned what dependent and independent variables are. I learned about deterministic and non-deterministic systems. I got to learn more about AI and how it has impacted our lives. We played Marshmallow and Spaghetti game to build the tallest standing structure. Unfortunately, my group 12 was not able to win it, but it encouraged collaboration and innovation among the groups.Through my graduate mentor, I learned about three different machine learning: 1. Supervised learning 2. Unsupervised learning 3. Reinforcement leraning. I learned more about text processing techniques in AI like Stemming and lemmatization. We did discussion on if AI will fully takeover jobs in future and it was engaging. I learned how AI is used in sports journalism by looking at some of the videos generated by AI in website sportbriefaisolutions.com.

reflection: |
  Overall it was a productive day. Last week we were just seeing each other online, but it was great to see each other personally and get to know about them. Marshmallow and spaghetti game was fun. Though we did not make the tallest structure, it was nice to see different approach by different groups. I got a chance to learn more about my project and how AI is used in sports journalism which is my field of research. I gained more information and knowledge about AI and machine learning.
