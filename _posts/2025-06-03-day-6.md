what_i_learned: |
  I learned about machine learning and its main ideas. I also learned about deep learning and data science. I now understand how machine learning is different from regular programming. I learned about the basic idea behind how machines learn. We talked more about supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. I also learned about classification and regression models. Finally, I learned how to use the Python library called Pandas.
