what_i_learned: |
  We started the day doing revision on the topics that we had learnt last week. Last week I only learned about the concept of stemmatization and lemmatization, but today I did coding on google colab to see how that works in python. I also learned about snowball stemmer and porter stemmer, and used it in google colab to see how that works. I also learned that snowball stemmer not only works in english, it works for many different languages as well. To see that, I typed sentences in spanish and saw how it gives root word for every words in sentence. I also learned how to use lemmatization and stemmatization in the dataframe as well.

  It took some time to debug the code to use lemmatization and  stemmatization in dataframe.
  
reflection: |
  Today was a productive day, and I felt more confident as we started with a quick revision. It was exciting to move from just learning the concepts last week to actually coding and seeing the results myself. Using the stemmatization and seeing how they work with different languages made the learning feel more real and interesting. Overall, I enjoyed the hands-on part of today and felt motivated to keep practicing more.
