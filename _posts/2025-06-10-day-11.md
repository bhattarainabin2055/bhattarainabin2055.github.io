what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned how to fetch football statistics using the API-Football service. I explored data for FC Barcelona in the 2012 UEFA Champions League season. I used Python with the requests library to access the API and pandas to organize the data into readable tables. The data included match outcomes, goals scored and conceded, penalty stats, and more. I learned how to extract nested JSON and display it clearly using DataFrames. This helped me understand how APIs and data analysis work together in sports analytics. I also learned about writing a research paper by looking at the samples. We started working on writing introduction part for our research paper.

  After getting the team’s statistics, it was difficult to fix the code to show the data in table form.
  
reflection: |
  Today I worked with a football API and explored Barcelona's stats from the 2012 Champions League. At first, the data looked very complicated and hard to understand. But once I broke it down and used pandas, it became much clearer. It felt good to turn messy data into neat tables. This made me feel more confident about using real data in project. Learning about writing a research paper will not only help me for this project, but for the future projects as well.
