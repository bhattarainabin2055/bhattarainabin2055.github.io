what_i_learned: |
  I learned about machine learning and its main ideas. I also learned about deep learning and data science. I now understand how machine learning is different from regular programming. I learned about the basic idea behind how machines learn. We talked more about supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. I also learned about classification and regression models. Finally, I learned how to use the Python library called Pandas.

reflection: |
  It was great learning about Git and GitHub since I have never heard and learned about it. Playing speed networking bingo was fun and informational at the same time. It was wonderful getting to know all the participants.
