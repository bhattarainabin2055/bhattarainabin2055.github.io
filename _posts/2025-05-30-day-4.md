what_i_learned: |
  I learned more about python about reading from a file. I learned how to create file and did coding using concepts of dictionary, list, reading and writing from file. Sharing projects by members of group gave me a chance to learn different ways to do coding for the same project. Through the workshop on introduction to generative AI and LLMS, I learned about generative AI, LLMS, AI and evolution of generative AI, machine learning and deep learning, tokenization and embeddings, and prompt engineering and techniques. Playing Kahoot game on generative AI was fun and informative at the same time. Identifying pictures if they are generated by generative AI or not was fun.

reflection: |
  Today was a productive and insightful day. I deepened my understanding of Python, particularly in working with files. The workshop on the introduction to generative AI and LLMs was both engaging and informative. The interactive elements of the day like Kahoot and Bot or Not made it even more enjoyable.Overall, the day offered a great balance of learning, practice, and interaction.
