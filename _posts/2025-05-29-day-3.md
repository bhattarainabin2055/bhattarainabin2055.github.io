what_i_learned: |
  I gained a solid understanding of computer vision and how it works. I learned about both object oriented and image oriented approches of computer vision. I learned about Teachable Machine which allowed me to train a model by providing images of pen, phone and remote and later asking it to identify those objects. I also woked with YOLO v8 in Google Colab where I used nano model to predict object in the image I uploaded and XL model to predict objects in the video I uploaded. We played Virtual Escape Room which was engaging and fun.
