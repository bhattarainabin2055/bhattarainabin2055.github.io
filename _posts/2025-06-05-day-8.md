what_i_learned: |
  Today was a enrichment day. I learned about different buildings in Morgan State University and what is taught in those buildings. I learned the locations of all those buildings and got to know the location of library, student service centre, gym and many more. I also got a chance to learn a little bit about history of Morgan State University. I also got some ideas on how to do video presentation for every friday by looking at the video sample. After that I learned about calling the API to get data. We worked on converting the data into rows and columns so that it will be easy to access. We also looked on sample for research paper.
blockers: |
  Code to call the API and transform the data into tabular form was not working.
  
reflection: |
  Today was a tiring day. Touring Morgan State University and visiting all the buildings was tiring, but it was helpful. Though I am a student at Morgan, I have never been to all the buildings. From the tour, I was able to know the locations of all the buildings which will be useful to me. Looking at the sample video will be helpful to me while making the video presentation. Debugging the code to call API and tansform data into tabular form improved my problem solving skills.
