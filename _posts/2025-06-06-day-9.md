  Today I learned about DataFrame and used different functions 
what_i_learned: |
  Today, I learned how to create a DataFrame in Python using the Pandas library by passing a dictionary of data into the pd.DataFrame() function. I explored how the data is organized in rows and columns, similar to a table. I also learned how to use the df.head() function to view the first few rows of the DataFrame. Using df.tail() allowed me to see the entries from the last. I learned to use df.columns() to list all the columns, df.max() to get maximum number from the dataset and df.min() the other way. I also learned to use df.std(), df.mean(), and df.describe() functions. We also discussed on writing research paper for our project. After that, we worked on our video presentation for the week.

  Today, I learned how to create and explore DataFrames using the Pandas library. I practiced viewing data with functions like head() and tail(), and used statistical methods such as mean(), std(), max(), min(), and describe() to analyze the dataset. Overall, it was a good step forward in understanding data handling in Python. I feel nervous speaking in front of people or on Zoom. Video presentations will definitely help me build confidence in my speaking skills.
