what_i_learned: |
 Today, I learned more about APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), which allow different software systems to communicate and share data easily. I also explored REST APIs, which follow a specific set of rules for interacting with web services using HTTP methods like GET and POST. I also learned about using the pycoingecko library to fetch real-time cryptocurrency data from the CoinGecko API. Then, I learned about the plotly library to create interactive visualizations of the data. Finally, I learned to use the .groupby() function in Python to group and analyze data based on specific categories, such as by coin or class. After the learning phase, we worked on weekly video presentation.

  Today, I gained a better understanding of what an API is and how it works. I learned that APIs help different programs talk to each other and share data easily. Seeing real examples made it easier to understand their purpose. I also explored how APIs are used in real-world applications like getting crypto data. Overall, it was a simple but important step in learning how modern software connects and functions.
