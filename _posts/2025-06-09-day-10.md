what_i_learned: |
  We started the day doing revision on the topics that we had learnt last week. Last week I only learned about the concept of stemmatization and lemmatization, but today I did coding on google colab to see how that works in python. I also learned about snowball stemmer and porter stemmer, and used it in google colab to see how that works. I also learned that snowball stemmer not only works in english, it works for many different languages as well. To see that, I typed sentences in spanish and saw how it gives root word for every words in sentence.

reflection: |
  It was great learning about Git and GitHub since I have never heard and learned about it. Playing speed networking bingo was fun and informational at the same time. Placement test on Python helped me check my knowledge on Python and topics that I need to learn more. It was wonderful getting to know all the participants. I enjoyed our first day of CEAMLS SAIRI.
