what_i_learned: |
  I learned about libraries in Python such as pandas.I learned about different built in functions such as .head, .ilock, .isnull, .fillna and .dropna. Using those functions I learned how to print all the items from data set, print just 20 rows, print rows from 25 to 100, print second and fifth column and checked if there were any missing data. After that I learned about how to train the dataset. I also learned about independent and dependent variable, and tried to figure out which is independent variable and dependent variable within the dataset. I learned about API which basically is the room to store data in secured way. I learned about API keys, which is a unique key to get access to the data. I learned how to call the API in python.

  While trying to train dataset, it took some time debugging the code because the code was not working. I faced some issues calling the API because code was not working.
  
reflection: |
  Today was a productive and interesting day. I learned new things in python, about working with dataset and different built-in functions to work with dataset. I learned about API which was a new topic to me. I am more comfortable with classifying the dependent and independent variables. Some parts were a bit challenging, but I enjoyed learning and practicing new skills. I feel like I made good progress and understand more now than I did before.
