what_i_learned: |
  I got a chance to talk to my project mentor and graduate research assistant, and got to know a little bit about project that I will be working on. We talked through how we are going to go through our projects. I learned about Lists, sets and dictionary in Python. Using Replit, I did some coding on how to add and delete elements, how to go through all the elements and how to create different data structures. We played Headband game and it was fun.
blockers: |
  No blockers.

reflection: |
   Learning Python was a revision for me. I got chance to discuss about the concepts that I had already studied and refresh it. It was good to know and talk to my project mentor and grdauate research assistant.
