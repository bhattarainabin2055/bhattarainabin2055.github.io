what_i_learned: |
  I got a chance to talk to my project mentor and graduate research assistant, and got to know a little bit about project that I will be working on. I learned about Lists, sets and dictionary in Python. Using Replit, I did some coding on how to add and delete elements, how to go through all the elements and how to create different data structures. We played Headband game and it was fun.
blockers: |
  No blockers.

reflection: |
   It was easy and quick revision for me since I have pretty good knowledge of Python.
