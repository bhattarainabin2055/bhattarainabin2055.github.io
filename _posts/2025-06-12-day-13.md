what_i_learned: |
  Today was enrichment day. I learned how to think quickly and creatively while playing the Taboo game. I improved my communication skills by finding alternative ways to describe words without using the obvious clues. Playing Jenga taught me the importance of patience and steady hands. I also learned that teamwork and focus are key to having fun and succeeding in group games. I began working on generating samples summary from the Barcelona match stat to train an AI model. We compiled all our code from this week in neat notebook so that it will be easy to access.

reflection: |
  Today was a fun and engaging day filled with laughter and friendly competition. Playing Taboo brought out everyone’s energy and made me appreciate how different people think and express themselves. Jenga was both exciting and nerve-wracking, especially as the tower grew taller and more unstable. Overall, I enjoyed spending time with others, building connections, and creating positive memories. I only generated sample summary today. I am excited to learn about training AI model from the samples generated.
