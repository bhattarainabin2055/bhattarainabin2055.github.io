what_i_learned: |
  I learned about machine learning and its main ideas. I also learned about deep learning and data science. I now understand how machine learning is different from regular programming. I learned about the basic idea behind how machines learn. We talked more about supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. I also learned about classification and regression models. Finally, I learned how to use the Python library called Pandas. The discussion session on what to do if AI do not want to shut down in the future helped me develop my creative thinking by encouraging me to explore complex, futuristic scenarios that don’t have clear-cut answers.

reflection: |
  Today was a good day. I learned new things and felt productive. The lessons about machine learning were interesting and helped me understand the topic better. I enjoyed going over the different types of learning and using Python tools like Pandas. The discussion question really challenged me to think outside the box. It made me realize how crucial it is to think critically and innovatively when dealing with emerging technologies.
